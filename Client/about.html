<div class="about-block"><h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>At Tandoori Mela, we aim to maintain an atmosphere that makes every guest feel welcomed as part of our family. Our mission is to bring forward good wholesome family eating, just as we would to a guest at our home. 
    </p>
    <p>Along with serving classic Indian favorites like Tandoori Chicken, Samosas, Pakora, Vindaloo, Korma, Tikka Masala, Rhoghan Josh, Butter Chicken, Palak Paneer, Daal Makhni, Goat Curry, Kati Wraps, and Biryanis, you’ll find exciting new additions you won’t find anywhere, like our signature Tandoori Mushroom, Chili Tava Chicken, and Chili-Garlic-Naan. Amongst a host of other house specialty naans and rotis, all of our breads are prepared fresh to serve in our Tandoor oven. We aim to have drinks and desserts to please everyone’s’ likings, from our Masala Chai (Tea) made with our very own blend of spices to the signature Rabri Fruit Creams and Badam Daal Halwa that will surely be great for anyone looking for a great dessert.</p>
    <p>Serving up our cuisine requires passion, dedication, integrity and heart at the forefront of our cooking; Chef Singh’s love for food, family gatherings and tradition is what keeps our mission in focus. His knowledge and experience with quality food, combined with his dedication to preserving the true culture of cooking is the drive that keeps us all motivated to serve our guests. With food being such an essential and sacred part of our beings, it is important to know that great food does not mean excessive oils, and that great Indian cuisine requires the usage of fresh herbs and spices. Our hope is that with each bite you get inspired, and feel the love and heart that went into your meal. 
    </p>
    <p>No fluff, no gimmicks just clean, wholesome family cooking coming straight from our kitchen to your table; we hope your next experience with us is both pleasurable and memorable.
    </p>
    <p>Welcome and thank you for allowing us to share our heritage and culture with you.
